# weekly-meals-API
A backend rest API which aims to keep track of weekly meals by utilising CRUD operations, allowing users to retrieve, create, update and delete meals from their account.

This project will make use of backend techngologies such as Node, Express and MongoDB with Mongoose. A frontend likely using either React or React Native for a mobile version will be created in the future.
